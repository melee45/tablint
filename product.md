## Product Type

csv-guard v1 is a **local CLI software tool**, not a hosted service.

- Runs entirely on the user’s machine
- No cloud infrastructure
- No user accounts
- No network calls required
- Fully offline

An API or hosted service is explicitly out of scope for v1.

---

## Monetization Model

csv-guard is monetized via **one-time license keys**.

### License Tiers

**Free Tier**
- Local CLI usage
- Hard limit: 50 validations per month
- Intended for evaluation and personal use

**Pro License**
- One-time purchase
- Unlimited validations
- CI/CD usage allowed
- No subscriptions

---

## Payment & Legal Handling

Payments are handled through a **Merchant of Record (MoR)** platform (e.g. Gumroad, LemonSqueezy, Paddle).

The MoR:
- Acts as the legal seller of the software
- Collects and remits applicable taxes (VAT, sales tax)
- Issues receipts to customers

The creator receives payouts as an individual.

### Important Constraints

- csv-guard v1 does NOT process payments directly
- No invoices or official receipts are generated by the software
- No business registration is required to run or use the software

Business registration and direct billing are explicitly postponed until future versions, if revenue justifies it.

## License Enforcement

License enforcement is performed locally via:

- A license key file stored on disk
- Signature verification
- No online checks
- No telemetry

License enforcement exists to encourage payment, not to prevent all misuse.

## Implementation Plan for v1

1. Scaffold CLI project structure.
2. Implement CSV parser.
3. Implement schema parser enforcing:
	- types: string | number | boolean
	- required fields
	- min/max (numbers)
	- exact length (strings)
	- unexpected columns produce warnings, not failures.
4. Implement validation engine:
	- row-based and column-based errors
	- clear error messages with row and column numbers.
5. Implement output module:
	- human-readable output (default)
	- JSON output with --json flag
	- summary section.
6. Implement license enforcement:
	- local license key file
	- offline signature verification using embedded public key
	- no network calls.
7. Implement usage counter:
	- one CLI invocation = one validation
	- local counter storage
	- reset monthly
	- free tier limit: 50 validations/month
	- clear error message when limit exceeded.
8. Add unit tests for:
	- schema parsing
	- validation rules
	- license enforcement.
9. Document installation, usage, pricing, and limitations in README.md.

Do not add:
- APIs
- network calls
- telemetry
- auto-fix logic
- AI-based validation
- payment processing
